Project Brief::

MVP:
Hosts should be able to:
 add a new mix and create a new DJ.
 edit and delete mixes and DJs.
Users should be able to:
 view a list of all mixes
 view a list of all DJs.
 view all mixes from a selected DJ. 
 view all mixes in a selected genre.
 view a single mix with a description, tracklist and audio link.

Completed Extensions:
Users are able to add and delete mixes from their personal MySource index.
Genres are added only when unique.
Genres have an associated color theme, which carries through the app.

Possible Additional Extensions:
Some mixes may have more than one DJ (many to many).
Users can request a new mix either by DJ or by genre, and pay for the mix.
Users could be able to rate mixes. 
There could be a button that picks a random mix for the user.
