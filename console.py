The title track is one of the most incredible pieces of music I have ever heard. 'I am telling myself the story of my life,' the narrator begins, and what follows is a sweeping tale of melancholy, regret, and longing. It's the kind of tune you put on late at night to think about the story of your own life. All 22 minutes of 'I Trawl the Megahertz' are included in this mix, because it's just that good. I am surrounding it with music that is equally patient, deliberate, and sensitive. There are only eight songs here, but all of them are very special to me. I hope you'll find something in them as well.",
